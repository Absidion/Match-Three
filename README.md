# Match Three

One of my current projects is a Match Three game for mobile.
I'm only testing this on my current phone which runs Android 6.0.
I acquired an SDK compatible for it through Android Studio.

This project is being built in Unity and you'll only find the Unity scripts in this drive and not other assets. 
The latest commit was 7/15/2018.
